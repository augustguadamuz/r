This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
# Vectors
# Fundamental data structure in R
# A vector stores an ordered set of values called elements
# All elements must be of the same type

# Let's construct a set of data containing data on three medical patients
# Create a vector named subject_name which contains three patient names, 
# a numeric vector named temperature, and a logical vector named flu_status

# first I am going to clear any existing data from the environment
rm(list=ls())

subject_name <- c("John Doe", "Jane Doe", "Steve Graves")
temperature <- c(98.1, 98.6, 101.4)
flu_status <- c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)

# to obtain the body temperature for element 2 (Jane Doe)

temperature[2]

# to obtain the body temperature of Jane Doe and Seteve Graves

temperature[2:3]

# get John and Steve's temperature by excluding Jane

temperature[-2]

# It is sometimes useful to specify a logical vector indicating 
# whether each item should be included. For example, to inlclude the first 
# two temperature readings but exclude the third:

temperature[c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)]

```

```{r}
# Factors
# Features that represent a characteristic with categories of values
# are known as 'nominal'. A factor is a special case of vector that 
# is used solely for representing nominal variables

# to create a factor from a charater vector, simply apply the
# factor() function

gender <- factor(c("MALE", "FEMALE", "MALE"))

gender

# Let's add another factor for blood type

blood <- factor(c("O", "AB", "A"),
                levels = c("A", "B", "AB", "O"))

blood
```

```{r}
# Lists
# Lists are used for storing ordered sets of values
# Lists allow for different types of values to be collected (unlike vectors)

# Let's create a list for John Doe so we can see his data without 
# having to list out each data value (e.g., blood, flu_staus) each time

subject1 <- list(fullname = subject_name[1], 
                 temperature = temperature[1],
                 flu_status = flu_status[1],
                 gender = gender[1], 
                 blood = blood[1])

# Printing the patient's data is now a single command

subject1
```

```{r}
# Data Frame
# Data frames are analagous to spreadsheets or databases as they 
# contain rows and columns of data

# Let's create a data frame for for our paient data set

pt_data <- data.frame(subject_name, temperature, flu_status, gender, blood, stringsAsfactors = FALSE)

# stringsAsfactors = FALSE prevents R from converting every character
# vector to a factor

# Our data looks like database or spreadsheet output now
pt_data

# Now we can pull vectors

pt_data$subject_name

# Similar to lists, a vector of names can be used to extract
# several columns from a data frame

pt_data[c("temperature", "flu_status")]

# we could also use numbers to identify the columns we want

pt_data[2:3]

# We can pull data by specifying the row and column

pt_data[1,2]
```
```{r}
# Matrix
# A matrix is a data structure that represents a two-dimensional table
# with rows and columns of data

# Let's create a 2X2 matrix with the first four letters of the alphabet

m <- matrix(c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd'), nrow = 2)

m
```
