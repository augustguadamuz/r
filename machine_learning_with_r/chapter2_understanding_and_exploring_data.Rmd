This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
# Exploring and Understanding Data

# first I am going to clear any existing data from the environment
rm(list=ls())

usedcars <- read.csv("C:/Users/augustg/Documents/R/r/machine_learning_with_r/2148OS_code/chapter 2/usedcars.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Look at the structure of the data

str(usedcars)

# Let's look at the summary statistics for the "year" feature

summary(usedcars$year)

# We can look at the summary statistics for several numeric variables at the same time

summary(usedcars[c("price", "mileage")])

# We can perform basic math functions

(36000 + 44000 + 56000)/3

mean(c(36000, 44000, 56000))

median(c(36000, 44000, 56000))

range(usedcars$mileage)
diff(range(usedcars$mileage))
diff(range(usedcars$price))

# Interquartile range (IQR)

IQR(usedcars$price)

# Generate quantiles
quantile(usedcars$price)

# If we specify an additional probs parameter using a vector denoting cut points
# we can obtain arbitrary quantiles

quantile(usedcars$price, probs = c(0.01, 0.99))

# The sequence function seq() is used for generating
# vectors of evenly spaced values. This makes it easy to obtain 
# other slices of data, such as the quintiles (five groups)

quantile(usedcars$price, seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.20))

IQR(usedcars$mileage)

summary(usedcars$mileage)

``` 
```{r}

# Visualizing numeric variables -- boxplots

# Clearing any exiting data from the environment
rm(list=ls())

# CTRL + L will clear the Console

# Load the used car data

usedcars <- read.csv("C:/Users/augustg/Documents/R/r/machine_learning_with_r/2148OS_code/chapter 2/usedcars.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Let's take a look at a boxplot for the used car price and mileage data.

boxplot(usedcars$price, main = "Boxplot of Used Car Prices", ylab = "Price ($)")
boxplot(usedcars$mileage, main = "Boxplot of Used Car Mileage", ylab = "Odometer (mi.)")

# Visualizing numeric variables -- Histograms

hist(usedcars$price, main = "Histogram of Used Car Prices", xlab = "Price ($)")


hist(usedcars$mileage, main = "Histogram of Used Car Mileage", xlab = "Odeometer (mi.)")

# Let's look at the variance and standard deviation of the price and mileage variables.

var(usedcars$price)
sd(usedcars$price)

var(usedcars$mileage)
sd(usedcars$mileage)
