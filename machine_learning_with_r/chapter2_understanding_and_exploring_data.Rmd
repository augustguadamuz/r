This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
# Exploring and Understanding Data

# first I am going to clear any existing data from the environment
rm(list=ls())

usedcars <- read.csv("C:/Users/augustg/Documents/R/r/machine_learning_with_r/2148OS_code/chapter 2/usedcars.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Look at the structure of the data

str(usedcars)

# Let's look at the summary statistics for the "year" feature

summary(usedcars$year)

# We can look at the summary statistics for several numeric variables at the same time

summary(usedcars[c("price", "mileage")])

# We can perform basic math functions

(36000 + 44000 + 56000)/3

mean(c(36000, 44000, 56000))

median(c(36000, 44000, 56000))

range(usedcars$mileage)
diff(range(usedcars$mileage))
diff(range(usedcars$price))

# Interquartile range (IQR)

IQR(usedcars$price)

# Generate quantiles
quantile(usedcars$price)

# If we specify an additional probs parameter using a vector denoting cut points
# we can obtain arbitrary quantiles

quantile(usedcars$price, probs = c(0.01, 0.99))

# The sequence function seq() is used for generating
# vectors of evenly spaced values. This makes it easy to obtain 
# other slices of data, such as the quintiles (five groups)

quantile(usedcars$price, seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.20))

IQR(usedcars$mileage)

summary(usedcars$mileage)

``` 
```{r}

# Visualizing numeric variables -- boxplots

# Clearing any exiting data from the environment
rm(list=ls())

# CTRL + L will clear the Console

# Load the used car data

usedcars <- read.csv("C:/Users/augustg/Documents/R/r/machine_learning_with_r/2148OS_code/chapter 2/usedcars.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Let's take a look at a boxplot for the used car price and mileage data.

boxplot(usedcars$price, main = "Boxplot of Used Car Prices", ylab = "Price ($)")
boxplot(usedcars$mileage, main = "Boxplot of Used Car Mileage", ylab = "Odometer (mi.)")

# Visualizing numeric variables -- Histograms

hist(usedcars$price, main = "Histogram of Used Car Prices", xlab = "Price ($)")


hist(usedcars$mileage, main = "Histogram of Used Car Mileage", xlab = "Odeometer (mi.)")

# Let's look at the variance and standard deviation of the price and mileage variables.

var(usedcars$price)
sd(usedcars$price)

var(usedcars$mileage)
sd(usedcars$mileage)

```{r}
# Exploring categorical variables
# In contrast to numeric data, categorical data is examined
# using tables rather than summary statistics
# A table that presents a single categorical variable is known as a one-way table
# The table() function can be used to generate one=way tables
# for our used car data

table(usedcars$year)
table(usedcars$model)
table(usedcars$color)

# R can also perform the calculation of table proportions directly by using the prop.table() command on a table produced by the table() function

model_table <- table(usedcars$model)
prop.table(model_table)

# Show the output of a prop.table() function
# in percettages with a single decimal place

color_table <- table(usedcars$color)
color_pct <- prop.table(color_table) * 100
round(color_pct, digits = 1)

```

```{r}

# measuring central tendency
# mode is commonly used for categorical variable
# mean and median are not categorized for nominal variables

# You cannot use the mode() function for nominal variables 
mode(color_table) # will kick "numeric" as output

```

```{r}
# Visualizing relationships -- scatterplots

# Scatterplot is a diagram that visualizes a bivariate relationship

# Examine the relationship between price and mileage
# Y plane is the dependent variable (price)

plot(x = usedcars$mileage, y = usedcars$price,
     main = "Scatterplot of Price vs. Mileage",
     xlab = "Used Car Odometer (mi.)",
     ylab = "Used Car Price ($)")

```
```{r}

# Examining relationships - two-way cross tablulations
# To examine the relationship between two nominal variables
# a two-way cross tabulation is used, also known as a
# crosstab or contingency table

# Examine the relationship between model and color

# Install the gmodels package
install.packages("gmodels")
library(gmodels)

# Simplify the data
# Divide the 9 colors into two groups
# Conservative or non-conservative

usedcars$conservative <- usedcars$color %in% c("Black", "Gray", "Silver", "White")

# The %in% operator returns TRUE or FALSE for each value in
# the vector on the left-hand side of the operator
# depending on whether the value is found on the right-hand
# side, basically we are asking if the color is 
# black, gray, silver, or white (TRUE/FALSE)

table(usedcars$conservative)

# Now, let's look at the cross-tabulation to see how the
# proportion of conservative colored cars varies by model

CrossTable(x = usedcars$model, y = usedcars$conservative)
