This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}

# first I am going to clear any existing data from the environment
rm(list=ls())

# pull in the data set
wbcd <- read.csv("C:/Users/augustg/Documents/R/r/machine_learning_with_r/2148OS_code/chapter 3/wisc_bc_data.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

#Let's look at the data structure

str(wbcd)

# We will drop the ID variable (they should always be excluded)
# We will make a copy of the wbcd file and exclude the first column (ID)

wbcd <- wbcd[-1]

str(wbcd)

# See how many of the results are benign and malignent
table(wbcd$diagnosis)

# We need to code the target feature as a factor
# We will take this opportunity to give the B and M values
# more informative labels using the labels parameter

wbcd$diagnosis <- factor(wbcd$diagnosis, levels = c("B", "M"),
                                                    labels = c("Benign", "Malignent"))

# Look at the prop.table() output
# Notice that the values have been relabeled

round(prop.table(table(wbcd$diagnosis)) * 100, digits = 1)

# At this point the remaining features are all numeric
# Let's take a look at some of the features

summary(wbcd[c("radius_mean", "area_mean", "smoothness_mean")])

# kNN uses a distance formula and the mean values have rather large deltas; we need to normalize the data

# Let's create a normalization fucntion

normalize <- function(x) {return ((x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x)))}

# Let's test the normalize function that we just created
normalize(c(1,2,3,4,5))
normalize(c(10,20,30,40,50))

# The lapply() function takes a list and applies a function to each element of the list
# We can use lapply() to apply normalize to each feature in our data frame

wbcd_n <- as.data.frame(lapply(wbcd[2:31], normalize))
# This command applies the normalize() function to columns 2 through 31 in the wbcd data frame
# converts the resulting list to a data frame and assigns it the name wbcd_n
# the _n is a reminder that the data has been normalized

# Let's confirm that the transaction was applied correctly

summary(wbcd_n$area_mean)
